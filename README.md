The programming language MSNL uses four elementary concepts (Mulitset, Sequence, Nest, Layer) to handle various data structures in a unified and concise manner. This makes it easy to combine different data structures and lowers the learning cost.

The name MSNL is derived from Mulitset, Sequence, Nest, Layer and Mishina Language.
